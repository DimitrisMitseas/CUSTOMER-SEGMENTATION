Analyzed sales revenue and created a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) technique to gain insights based on customersâ€™ past purchasing behavior. I utilized SQL queries (CTEs and Window Functions) to explore the problem. I aimed to enhance product development, improve customer experience and increase sales and revenue.
